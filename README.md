# [DEPRECATED] TINET Bridge
## Why?
TINET Bridge IS DEPRECATED. We are using [lwip-ce](https://google.com) for communication.  
lwip-ce is great because it literally is an ethernet cable or a WiFi adapter supporting WPS,
which makes it better in terms of communication and protocol support.

The [documentation](https://tinetdocs.tkbstudios.com/) is updated.

## Old README
This program makes the connection between your calculator and our main servers possible!
